00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to our exciting minute of math, today we are exploring simple triangles!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,363
Our opening scene begins with the words "Simple Triangles" majestically

3
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:11,727
appearing on screen in a bold, orange font.

4
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:16,090
At [0:05], an equilateral triangle materializes, its sides all the same

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,454
length. Let's label each side as "a".

6
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:24,818
At [0:10], show the formula "a equals a equals a" to demonstrate

7
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:29,181
all sides are equal. At [0:15], a line splits the triangle in

8
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:33,545
half, forming two right-angled triangles.

9
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:37,909
At [0:20], we reveal the height "h" and base "a/2", showing the

10
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:42,272
formula "h equals square root of a squared minus (a/2) squared".

11
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:46,636
At [0:25], animate a checkmark confirming the equation.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
Now, let's talk about isosceles triangles, where two sides are equal.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,378
The scene shifts to a new triangle, this time it's an isosceles

5
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:42,757
triangle. At [0:34], we label two sides as "b" and the base

6
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:48,136
as "a". At [0:37], we split the triangle in half again, showing

7
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:53,515
two right-angled triangles. At [0:40], we reveal the height "h" and half

8
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:58,893
base "a/2", showing the formula "h equals square root of b squared

9
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:04,272
minus (a/2) squared". At [0:45], animate a checkmark confirming the equation.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,900
Lastly, let's see these triangles in action!

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,166
Our final scene displays a pyramid, a real-world example of equilateral

7
00:00:56,166 --> 00:01:00,333
triangles. At [0:55], we see a tent, demonstrating isosceles triangles.

8
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,500
At [0:58], the phrases "equal sides for stability" and "two sides equal

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,666
for balance" overlay the pyramid and tent respectively.

10
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:12,833
At [0:60], the words "Triangles in Real Life" flash, concluding our minute

11
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:17,000
of math.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,636
And that, my friends, is a brief introduction to simple triangles!

8
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:07,272
Thanks for joining us, and remember - triangles make the world go

9
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:10,909
round!
