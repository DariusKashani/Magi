  [NEW CONCEPT]
  Let's explore what a derivative really means using a simple example.
  Imagine you're driving a car and you want to know how fast you're going at any exact moment.
  Your speedometer shows your instantaneous speed, but how is that calculated?
  This is exactly what a derivative does - it measures the rate of change at a specific point.
  Let's say you're driving and your position changes over time.
  If we plot your position on a graph with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis, we get a curve.
  The derivative at any point on this curve tells us the slope of the line that just touches the curve at that point - this is called the tangent line.
  The steeper the slope, the faster you're going.
  If the curve is flat, your speed is zero.
  If the curve goes down, you're moving backwards.
  This concept of finding the instantaneous rate of change is fundamental to calculus and appears everywhere in science, engineering, and economics.

  The formal definition of a derivative involves the concept of limits, which allows us to find the exact slope of a curve at any point.
  Consider a function f(x) and a point where we want to find the derivative.
  We start by taking two points on the curve that are very close together - one at x and another at x plus a tiny amount we call h.
  The slope between these two points is the change in y divided by the change in x, which equals f(x plus h) minus f(x) all over h.
  This gives us the average rate of change between the two points.
  But we want the instantaneous rate of change, not the average.
  To get this, we make h smaller and smaller, approaching zero.
  As h approaches zero, the two points get closer and closer together, and the slope of the line connecting them approaches the slope of the tangent line at point x.
  This limiting process is written as the limit as h approaches zero of f(x plus h) minus f(x) over h.
  When this limit exists, we call it the derivative of f at x, often written as f prime of x or df/dx.
  This definition might seem abstract, but it's the foundation for all derivative calculations and gives us a precise way to measure instantaneous rates of change.

  [NEW CONCEPT]
  The concept of differentiability is more nuanced than simple existence of a derivative.
  A function is differentiable at a point if the derivative exists at that point, but this requires several conditions to be met simultaneously.
  First, the function must be continuous at the point - there cannot be any jumps or gaps.
  However, continuity alone is not sufficient for differentiability.
  The function must also be smooth, meaning it cannot have any sharp corners or cusps.
  Consider the absolute value function f(x) equals the absolute value of x.
  This function is continuous everywhere, including at x equals zero, but it has a sharp corner at the origin.
  When we try to compute the derivative at x equals zero using the limit definition, we find that the left-hand limit and right-hand limit give different values.
  The left-hand derivative is negative one, while the right-hand derivative is positive one.
  Since these one-sided limits don't agree, the derivative doesn't exist at x equals zero, making the function non-differentiable at that point.
  This illustrates an important principle: differentiability is a stronger condition than continuity.
  Every differentiable function is continuous, but not every continuous function is differentiable.
  In multivariable calculus, this concept becomes even more complex, requiring partial derivatives to exist and satisfy additional smoothness conditions.
