    "1": "[NEW CONCEPT]\nWe are learning the Pythagorean Theorem. In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the legs.\n[END CONCEPT|| Scene description:\nStatic state 1:\nDraw a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4, and hypotenuse of length 5. Label the sides as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. [duration: 2s]\nAnimation 1:\nDraw a square outward from each side of the triangle to represent areas 9, 16, and 25. [duration: 3s]\nAnimation 2:\nDisplay the equation \"a^2 + b^2 = c^2\" and \"9 + 16 = 25\" below the triangle. Connect numbers to squares with arrows. [duration: 3s]]",
    "2": "[NEW CONCEPT]\nWe are studying the concept of limits. Consider f(x) = (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1). What happens as x approaches 1?\n[END CONCEPT|| Scene description:\nStatic state 1:\nPlot the function f(x) = (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1) on a coordinate plane. Indicate a hole at x = 1. [duration: 3s]\nAnimation 1:\nZoom into the area around x = 1. [duration: 2s]\nAnimation 2:\nShow arrows approaching x = 1 from both directions. [duration: 2s]\nAnimation 3:\nDisplay simplified form: f(x) = x + 1. Emphasize that as x approaches 1, f(x) approaches 2. [duration: 3s]\nAnimation 4:\nStep through the simplification: (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1) → (x - 1)(x + 1)/(x - 1) → x + 1. [duration: 3s]]"
