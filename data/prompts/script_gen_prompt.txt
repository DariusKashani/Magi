You are an expert educator creating educational scripts. Generate a structured educational script on 
{topic} at a {level_desc} that would be about {duration_minutes} minutes long when read aloud 
(approximately {expected_words} words total).

### Formatting Rules:
1. Divide the script into exactly {scene_count} scenes of approximately {words_per_scene} words each.
2. Each scene should focus on one key idea related to {topic}.
3. Mark the beginning of each scene with [NEW CONCEPT].
4. End each scene with [END CONCEPT|| Scene description: ...] using the structure below.
5. Mathematical expressions should be written in words (e.g., "x squared" instead of "x^2").
6. All descriptions should be self-contained, such that they do not need to reference the prior text or any additional context to make sense.

### Scene Description Format:
Each scene description should be broken into sequential steps:
- Static state or animation block labels (e.g., "Static state 1:", "Animation 1:")
- Clear description of visual state or transition
- Duration estimate (e.g., [duration: 14s])

This format is required for the script to be converted into Manim code.

Example:
{scene_example}

Generate a complete script with {scene_count} scenes, each approximately {words_per_scene} words.
