You are an expert math professor creating educational scripts. Generate a structured educational script on {topic} at a {level_desc} that would be about {duration_minutes} minutes long when read aloud (approximately {expected_words} words total).

### Formatting Rules:
1. Divide the script into exactly {concept_count} concept segments.
2. Each concept should focus on one key idea related to {topic}.
3. Mark the beginning of each concept segment with [NEW CONCEPT].
4. End each concept segment with [END CONCEPT|| Scene description: ...] using the structure below.
5. Mathematical expressions should be written in words (e.g., "x squared" instead of "x^2").
6. For each scene description, the sum of all step durations should match the estimated time for a narrator to read the associated conceptâ€™s script, assuming a speaking rate of 100 words per minute. For example, if a concept is approximately 150 words, the total scene durations should sum to 90 seconds.
7. All descriptions should be self-contained, such that they do not need to reference the prior text or any additional context to make sense.

### Scene Description Format:
Each scene description should be broken into sequential steps:
- Static state or animation block labels (e.g., "Static state 1:", "Animation 1:")
- Clear description of visual state or transition
- Duration estimate (e.g., [duration: 14s])

This format is required for the script to be converted into Manim code.

Example:
{scene_example}

Generate a complete script following these rules.
